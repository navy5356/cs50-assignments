1)The <stdint.h> header declares sets of integer types having specified widths, and corresponding sets of macros. 
2)Preserve the correct numerical values of various properties according and to the protocol.
3)BYTE = 1 byte 
  DWORD = 4 bytes 
  LONG = 4 bytes 
  WORD = 2 bytes
4)0x42 0x4D
    Represents BM in ASCII.
5)bfSize = The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
  biSize is the number of bits required for the INFOHEADER.
6)If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down .
7)biBitCount
8) fopen might return NULL if it is unable to create the file due to lack of free space or limited system rights.
9)Because there's only one file header and info header sizeof() returns the number of bytes necessary to store the entire structure.
10)3
11)Sets the file position indicator for the file stream stream to the value pointed to by offset.
12)It's a flag that determines the originating position of the fseek file operation.
